## 003 - Weather Observation Station 20

## üìò Problem Statement

A **median** is defined as a number separating the higher half of a data set from the lower half.  

Write a SQL query to **find the median of Northern Latitudes (`LAT_N`)** from the `STATION` table and **round your answer to 4 decimal places**.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Notes

- Median = middle value of a sorted dataset.  
- Odd number of rows ‚Üí middle value.  
- Even number of rows ‚Üí average of the two middle values.

## ‚úÖ SQL Solution (Using CTE + Window Functions)

```sql
WITH ordered AS (
    SELECT
        LAT_N,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY LAT_N) AS rn,
        COUNT(*) OVER () AS total_count
    FROM STATION
)
SELECT
    ROUND(AVG(LAT_N), 4) AS median
FROM ordered
WHERE rn IN (FLOOR((total_count + 1) / 2), CEIL((total_count + 1) / 2));
