"003 - yTranspose and Flatten"

"""
Problem

Transpose We can generate the transposition of an array using the tool numpy.transpose.
It will not affect the original array, but it will create a new array.

Flatten The tool flatten creates a copy of the input array flattened to one dimension.

Task

You are given a N X M integer array matrix with space separated elements (N = rows and M = columns).
Your task is to print the transpose and flatten results.

Input Format

The first line contains the space separated values of N and M. The next N lines contains the space separated elements of M columns.

Output Format

First, print the transpose array and then print the flatten.

Sample Input 0

2 2
1 2
3 4
Sample Output 0

[[1 3]
 [2 4]]
[1 2 3 4]
